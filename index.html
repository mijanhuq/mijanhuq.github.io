        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a quantitative researcher and technologist whose career bridges the computational frontiers of physics and quantitative finance. My research interests center on applying advanced computational methods—from high-performance Monte Carlo simulation and parallel computing to modern deep learning and AI techniques—to solve complex problems in both domains.</p>
        <p>The common thread across my work is a focus on building scalable, high-performance computational systems that push the boundaries of what's computationally feasible—whether simulating the collision of black holes or forecasting credit risk across massive portfolios. My approach combines deep mathematical and methodological rigor with hands-on implementation expertise, allowing me to move fluidly between theoretical modeling and production-scale systems. I have led the development of multiple end-to-end quantitative platforms, from architecture and framework design through implementation, testing, and production deployment.</p>
        <p>Beyond technical work, I have a genuine interest in building and managing teams, coaching team members, and establishing robust engineering and product processes that enable effective product development, implementation, testing, and go-to-market strategies in startups and research organizations.</p>
