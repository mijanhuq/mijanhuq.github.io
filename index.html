                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a quantitative researcher and technologist whose career bridges the computational frontiers of physics and quantitative finance. My research interests center on applying advanced computational methods—from high-performance Monte Carlo simulation and parallel computing to modern deep learning and AI techniques—to solve complex problems in both domains.</p>
                
                <p>In finance, my work focuses on computational risk analytics, pricing models, and the application of machine learning to accelerate quantitative workflows. My recent research explores using AI and deep learning for derivative pricing, sensitivity prediction, and analytics automation, bringing modern computational paradigms to traditional quantitative finance problems.</p>
                
                <p>My physics interests remain rooted in numerical relativity and gravitational wave research—areas where I contributed to large-scale simulations of binary black hole mergers earlier in my career. Currently, I am exploring how large language models and AI-assisted techniques can advance scientific discovery, including applications to model discovery and research workflow automation in physics.</p>
                
                <p>The common thread across both domains is my focus on building scalable, high-performance computational systems that push the boundaries of what's computationally feasible—whether simulating the collision of black holes or forecasting credit risk across massive portfolios. My approach combines deep mathematical and methodological rigor with hands-on implementation expertise, allowing me to move fluidly between theoretical modeling and production-scale systems. This dual perspective positions me uniquely to explore emerging AI techniques not as abstract tools, but as practical methods for advancing quantitative research in both physics and finance.</p>
